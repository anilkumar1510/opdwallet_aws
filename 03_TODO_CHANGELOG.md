3. **NestJS for API**: Selected for its enterprise-grade structure and TypeScript support
4. **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexibility in schema evolution
5. **JWT with HTTP-only Cookies**: Secure authentication without localStorage vulnerabilities
6. **Docker Compose**: Simplified local development and consistent environments

### UI/UX Decisions
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Primary users will access via mobile devices
2. **Progressive Web App**: Native-like experience without app store distribution
3. **Teal Brand Color**: Healthcare-friendly, calming color palette
4. **System Font Stack**: Fast loading, no external font dependencies
5. **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations for better user experience
6. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first for rapid development

### Security Decisions
1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier role system for granular permissions
2. **Bcrypt for Passwords**: Industry-standard password hashing
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force and DOS attacks
