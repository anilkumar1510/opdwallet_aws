## Design Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Chose monorepo to keep all services together for easier development and deployment
2. **Next.js App Router**: Using App Router for better performance and server components support
3. **NestJS for API**: Selected for its enterprise-grade structure and TypeScript support
4. **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexibility in schema evolution
5. **JWT with HTTP-only Cookies**: Secure authentication without localStorage vulnerabilities
6. **Docker Compose**: Simplified local development and consistent environments

### UI/UX Decisions
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Primary users will access via mobile devices
2. **Progressive Web App**: Native-like experience without app store distribution
3. **Teal Brand Color**: Healthcare-friendly, calming color palette
4. **System Font Stack**: Fast loading, no external font dependencies
5. **CSS Transitions Only**: Removed Framer Motion due to type conflicts
6. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first for rapid development

### Deployment Decisions (September 2025)
1. **Development Mode for Demo**: Running without auth for simplicity
2. **HTTP Only**: No SSL for initial deployment (must fix for production)
3. **Manual Deployment**: GitHub Actions requires workflow scope
4. **Docker Compose**: All services in single orchestration
5. **No MongoDB Auth**: Simplified for development (critical to fix)

### Security Decisions
1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier role system for granular permissions
2. **Bcrypt for Passwords**: Industry-standard password hashing
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force and DOS attacks
4. **Input Validation**: DTO-based validation at API level
5. **CORS Configuration**: Restrict API access to known domains

## Notes

### Development Environment

- **Member**: john.doe@company.com / Member@123
- **Dependent**: jane.doe@email.com / Dependent@123
- **Member ID**: OPD000001 (John), OPD000002 (Jane)
- **UHID**: UH000001 (John), UH000002 (Jane)

### Known Issues

## Lessons Learned (September 15, 2025)

### What Went Wrong
1. **MongoDB Authentication**: Initial setup with auth failed due to Docker volume persistence
2. **Cookie Security**: Production settings don't work with HTTP
3. **GitHub Actions**: Personal Access Token lacks workflow scope
4. **Password Hashing**: Multiple attempts needed to get correct hash
5. **Nginx Configuration**: Default config didn't handle Next.js static files

### What Worked
1. **Docker Compose**: Simplified multi-service deployment
2. **Manual SSH Deployment**: Direct control over server
3. **Development Mode**: Bypassed security for quick demo
4. **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Clean URL structure once configured

### Current Security Risks ðŸš¨
1. **No Authentication on MongoDB** - Anyone with access can read/write
2. **HTTP Only** - Credentials sent in plain text
3. **Hardcoded Secrets** - JWT secret in code
4. **CORS Wide Open** - Any site can call API
5. **No Rate Limiting** - Vulnerable to DOS attacks
6. **No Input Validation** - XSS/Injection possible
7. **Cookies Without Secure Flag** - Session hijacking risk
8. **Default Ports Open** - MongoDB accessible if firewall fails

### Development vs Production Configuration Differences
| Setting | Development (Current) | Production (Required) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Protocol | HTTP | HTTPS with SSL/TLS |
| MongoDB Auth | None | Username/Password with roles |
| JWT Secret | Hardcoded | Environment variable (256-bit) |
| Cookie Secure | false | true |
| Cookie Domain | Empty | .yourdomain.com |
| CORS Origins | * (all) | Specific domains only |
| NODE_ENV | development | production |
| Rate Limiting | None | 100 req/min per IP |
| Session Duration | 7 days | 1 hour |
| Bcrypt Rounds | 10 | 12+ |
