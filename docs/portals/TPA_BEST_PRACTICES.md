## Claim Assignment Best Practices

### For TPA Admins

#### Balanced Workload Distribution

**Monitor Real-Time Workload**:
- Check workload dashboard regularly
- Track active claims per user
- Monitor claims by status distribution
- Review capacity utilization metrics
- Identify overburdened users early

**Avoid Common Pitfalls**:
- Don't overload high performers
- Avoid assigning all complex claims to one user
- Don't ignore user availability (PTO, training, meetings)
- Balance urgent and routine claims across team
- Prevent burnout through fair distribution

**Workload Balancing Strategies**:
- Maintain 20% variance or less across users
- Rotate high-value claims among experienced users
- Give junior users learning opportunities

- Use system metrics to guide assignments

---

#### Smart Assignment Strategy

**Match Complexity to Expertise**:
- Assign complex claims to senior users
- Route specialized claims to domain experts
- Give routine claims to newer team members
- Consider medical specialty knowledge
- Match high-value claims to experienced reviewers

**Efficiency Through Clustering**:
- Assign similar claims to same user
- Group claims by provider when possible
- Cluster geographic regions
- Batch similar claim types
- Maintain continuity on related claims

**Expertise Considerations**:
- Orthopedic claims → Users with orthopedic experience
