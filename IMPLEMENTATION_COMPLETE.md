## üîß How It Works

### Appointment Booking Flow

1. **User books appointment** ‚Üí API calculates copay based on policy config
2. **Three scenarios**:
   - **Sufficient wallet + copay**: Wallet debited ‚Üí Payment screen for copay
   - **Insufficient wallet**: Payment screen for full amount
   - **Sufficient wallet, no copay**: Direct success
3. **Payment screen** ‚Üí User clicks "Mark as Paid" (dummy gateway)
4. **Success** ‚Üí Redirected back to appointments page

### Payment Breakdown

For every transaction, the system tracks:
- **Total Amount**: Full service cost
- **Wallet Amount**: Amount debited from wallet
- **Self Paid Amount**: Amount paid by member (copay or out-of-pocket)
- **Copay Amount**: Specific copay portion (if applicable)
- **Payment Method**: Classification (WALLET_ONLY, COPAY, OUT_OF_POCKET, etc.)

### Order History

Members can view:
- **Order List**: All transactions with status, payment method, amounts
- **Order Details**: Detailed breakdown, timeline, payment method
- **Summary Stats**: Total orders, total spent, wallet usage, self-paid

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Backend API Testing

```bash
# Start backend
cd api
npm run start:dev

# Test payment creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "USER_ID",
    "amount": 200,
    "paymentType": "COPAY",
    "serviceType": "APPOINTMENT",
    "serviceId": "APT-001",
    "serviceReferenceId": "APT-001",
    "description": "Copay for appointment"
  }'

# Test mark as paid
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/payments/PAY-20250116-0001/mark-paid \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get transactions
curl http://localhost:4000/api/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get transaction summary
curl http://localhost:4000/api/transactions/summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Frontend Testing

```bash
# Start frontend
cd web-member
npm run dev
```

**Test Flow**:
1. Navigate to `/member/appointments`
2. Book an appointment with a doctor
3. Go through the booking flow
4. If payment required, you'll be redirected to `/member/payments/[paymentId]`
5. Click "Mark as Paid"
6. See success screen and redirect back
7. View order history at `/member/orders`
8. Click on an order to see details

### 3. End-to-End Scenarios

**Scenario A: With Copay**
1. Set up policy with copay configuration (e.g., 20% or ‚Çπ150)
2. Ensure user has sufficient wallet balance
3. Book appointment
4. Verify wallet debited for consultation fee minus copay
5. Verify payment screen shows copay amount
6. Mark as paid
7. Check transaction summary shows correct breakdown

**Scenario B: Insufficient Balance**
1. Set user wallet balance to less than consultation fee
2. Book appointment
3. Verify payment screen shows full amount
4. Mark as paid
5. Check transaction status

**Scenario C: No Copay**
1. Set policy with no copay or disable copay
2. Ensure user has sufficient wallet balance
3. Book appointment
4. Verify direct success without payment screen
5. Check transaction shows WALLET_ONLY payment method

## üöÄ Production Readiness

**To make this production-ready**:

1. **Replace Dummy Gateway**: Integrate real payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe, etc.)
   - Update `payment.service.ts` ‚Üí `markAsPaid()` method
   - Add webhook handlers for payment confirmation
   - Add payment gateway response handling

2. **Add Payment Confirmation Flow**:
   - Implement `confirmAppointmentAfterPayment()` endpoint
   - Call this after real payment gateway confirms payment
   - Update transaction status to COMPLETED

3. **Add Security**:
   - Add payment signature verification
   - Add rate limiting on payment APIs
   - Add fraud detection

4. **Add Notifications**:
   - Email/SMS notifications for payment requests
   - Payment success/failure notifications

5. **Add Reporting**:
   - Payment reconciliation reports
   - Transaction analytics dashboard
