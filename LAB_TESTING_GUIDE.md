## Step 3: Test Edge Cases & Validations

### Test Case 1: Delayed Prescription

3. Enter reason: "Prescription image is blurry"
4. Verify prescription status → **DELAYED**
5. No cart should be created
6. Member should see delayed status with reason

### Test Case 2: Multiple Vendors Comparison

2. Check pricing from all 4 vendors
3. Verify:
   - Different prices for same tests
   - Home collection charges vary
   - Total amounts are different
   - Cheapest option is highlighted

### Test Case 3: Slot Availability
1. Try booking same slot multiple times (max 5 bookings per slot)
2. After 5 bookings, slot should show "Full"
3. Verify `currentBookings` counter increments

### Test Case 4: Invalid Pincode
1. Try entering a pincode not in serviceable list (e.g., 999999)
2. Verify: No vendors appear
3. Error message: "No vendors available in your area"

### Test Case 5: Order Cancellation
1. Place an order
2. In admin portal, cancel the order
3. Enter cancellation reason
4. Verify status → **CANCELLED**
5. Verify `cancelledAt` timestamp
6. Member should see cancellation reason

2. Verify: Cart is not available
3. Proper error handling

### Test Case 7: File Upload Validation
1. Try uploading file > 10MB → should fail
2. Try uploading non-image file (e.g., .txt) → should fail
3. Try uploading without patient name → should fail

---

## Step 4: Verify Database Records

### Check MongoDB Collections

#### 4.1 Lab Services
```bash
# In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.lab_services.countDocuments()  // Should be 25
db.lab_services.find({ category: 'PATHOLOGY' }).count()  // Should be 18
```

#### 4.2 Lab Vendors
```bash
db.lab_vendors.countDocuments()  // Should be 4
db.lab_vendors.find({ isActive: true })
```

#### 4.3 Lab Vendor Pricing
```bash
db.lab_vendor_pricing.countDocuments()  // Should be 100 (25 services × 4 vendors)
db.lab_vendor_pricing.find({ serviceId: ObjectId('...') })  // Check pricing for one service
```

#### 4.4 Lab Vendor Slots
```bash
db.lab_vendor_slots.countDocuments()  // Should be ~2520
db.lab_vendor_slots.find({ date: '2025-10-26' })  // Check slots for specific date
```

#### 4.5 Lab Prescriptions
```bash
db.lab_prescriptions.find()  // Your uploaded prescriptions
db.lab_prescriptions.find({ status: 'DIGITIZED' })
```

#### 4.6 Lab Carts
```bash
db.lab_carts.find()  // Your created carts
db.lab_carts.find({ status: 'ORDERED' })
```

#### 4.7 Lab Orders
```bash
db.lab_orders.find()  // Your placed orders
db.lab_orders.find({ status: 'COMPLETED' })
```

```

#### 5.3 Digitize Prescription
```bash
POST /api/ops/lab/prescriptions/[prescriptionId]/digitize
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "prescriptionId": "PRES-...",
  "status": "DIGITIZED",
  "items": [
    {
      "serviceId": "LAB-001",
      "serviceName": "Complete Blood Count (CBC)",
      "serviceCode": "CBC",
      "category": "PATHOLOGY"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 5.4 Get Vendors by Pincode
```bash
GET /api/member/lab/vendors/available?pincode=400001
```

#### 5.5 Get Vendor Slots
```bash
GET /api/member/lab/vendors/[vendorId]/slots?pincode=400001&date=2025-10-26
```

#### 5.6 Create Order
```bash
POST /api/member/lab/orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "cartId": "CART-...",
  "vendorId": "[vendor ObjectId]",
  "collectionType": "HOME_COLLECTION",
  "collectionAddress": {
    "fullName": "Test User",
    "phone": "+91-9876543210",
    "addressLine1": "123 Test Street",
    "pincode": "400001",
    "city": "Mumbai",
    "state": "Maharashtra"
  },
  "collectionDate": "2025-10-26",
