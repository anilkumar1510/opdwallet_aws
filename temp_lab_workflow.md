# Lab Module - Complete Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The lab diagnostics module allows members to order lab tests (blood tests, X-rays, etc.) by uploading their prescription, and having operations staff convert it into an order.

## The Complete Lab Journey

### Step 1: Member Uploads Prescription üì§
**Member Portal** (`/member/lab-tests/upload`)

- Member takes a photo of their doctor's prescription for lab tests
- Uploads the image/PDF (max 10MB)
- Adds patient name and optional notes
- System creates a **LabPrescription** record with status `UPLOADED`
- File is saved to `uploads/lab-prescriptions/`

### Step 2: Operations Team Digitizes üíª
**Admin Portal** (`/operations/lab/prescriptions/[id]/digitize`)

The operations team sees the uploaded prescription and converts it to a digital cart:

1. **View prescription image** side-by-side with a test catalog
2. **Search lab services** by name or code (e.g., "CBC", "Blood Sugar")
3. **Add tests** from the catalog that match the prescription
4. **Create cart** or mark as "Delayed" if unclear

When digitized:
- Prescription status ‚Üí `DIGITIZED`
- A **LabCart** is automatically created with all selected tests
- Member gets notified that their cart is ready

### Step 3: Member Reviews Cart üõí
**Member Portal** (`/member/lab-tests/cart/[id]`)

- Member sees all the tests that were added
- Reviews test names, codes, and categories
- Can proceed to select a vendor

### Step 4: Member Selects Lab Vendor üè•
**Member Portal** (`/member/lab-tests/cart/[id]/vendor/[vendorId]`)

Member chooses:

1. **Lab vendor** (based on their pincode)
   - System shows only vendors that service their area
   - Each vendor has their own pricing for tests

2. **Collection type:**
   - **Home Collection**: Lab person comes to your home (extra charges apply)
   - **Center Visit**: Go to the lab center (no extra charges)

3. **Date & Time Slot** for sample collection
   - See available slots from the vendor
   - Book a specific time slot

### Step 5: Order Placement ‚úÖ
**System creates LabOrder:**

**Pricing calculation:**
- Fetches each test's price from the vendor's pricing table
- Calculates: `actualPrice` (MRP) vs `discountedPrice` (selling price)
- Adds home collection charges if applicable
- Final amount = total discounted price + home collection charges

**Order details:**
- Order ID generated (e.g., `ORD-1234567890-ABC123`)
- Status: `PLACED`
- Payment status: `PENDING`
- Collection address (if home collection)
- Collection date/time and slot booking

### Step 6: Order Fulfillment üì¶
**Operations team manages order through statuses:**

1. **`PLACED`** ‚Üí New order received
2. **`CONFIRMED`** ‚Üí Vendor confirmed the booking
3. **`SAMPLE_COLLECTED`** ‚Üí Sample collected from patient
4. **`PROCESSING`** ‚Üí Lab is testing the samples
5. **`COMPLETED`** ‚Üí Report uploaded and ready
6. **`CANCELLED`** ‚Üí Order cancelled (with reason)

## Real-world Example

**User Story:**
1. Patient gets prescription from doctor for "CBC, Blood Sugar, Lipid Profile"
2. Uploads prescription photo via mobile app
3. Ops team digitizes it ‚Üí adds 3 tests to cart
4. Member sees cart with 3 tests
5. Selects "PathLab" (‚Çπ350 total) over "Quest Diagnostics" (‚Çπ450)
6. Chooses home collection for next day 9-10 AM
7. Order placed: ‚Çπ350 + ‚Çπ50 home collection = ‚Çπ400
8. Sample collected next day
9. Report ready in 24 hours ‚Üí uploaded by ops
10. Member downloads PDF report
