# 01_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md
**Last Updated: September 19, 2025**
**Current Deployment: http://51.20.125.246**

## ðŸ“‹ PROJECT OPERATING RULES (DO NOT DEVIATE)

### 1. Mode
- **Engineering Excellence**: Ship clean, optimized, professional code as a top-tier engineer
- **Security by Default**: Apply OWASP ASVS/Top-10, least privilege, secrets hygiene, strict validation, audit trails
- **Clarity First**: If unclear or blocked, pause and askâ€”no guessing, no hacks

### 2. Documentation: Single Source of Truth
Maintain these three files at repo root (update after EVERY change):
1. **01_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md** â€” Vision, roles, flows, endpoints, UI map, integrations, environments (AWS), deployment notes, ADRs
2. **02_DATA_SCHEMA_AND_CREDENTIALS.md** â€” MongoDB collections, indexes, sample docs, migrations, config keys (placeholders only), external endpoints
3. **03_TODO_CHANGELOG.md** â€” Task list, decisions, dated changelog (what/why/when/by whom)

**Rule**: Any PR that changes code MUST update these docs. No exceptions.

### 3. Read Before You Build
- Read all three docs (and ADRs) before coding
- Confirm understanding & approach in one short paragraph
- Proceed step-by-step with verification at each stage

### 4. Docker-Only Runtime
- Everything runs via Docker and docker-compose (no local services outside containers)
- Provide: Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, make/npx scripts for: up, down, logs, seed, test, lint, typecheck
- Current implementation: âœ… Docker Compose with all services

### 5. Security Baseline (Apply Everywhere)
- **AuthN**: httpOnly secure cookies + JWT rotation; session invalidation
- **AuthZ**: Strict RBAC + resource checks (prevent IDOR)
- **Validation**: Input & output validation (server & client)
- **Files**: Scan (AV), store privately, serve via short-lived signed URLs
- **Headers**: Prod-grade CSP/CORS/CSRF, rate-limits, dependency scanning
- **Audit**: Immutable log on admin/ops/member actions (who/what/when/before/after)
- **Secrets**: Never in code or docsâ€”environment/secret manager only

### 6. Database Quality (MongoDB)
- Design optimized schemas with explicit indexes
- Critical queries: Attach explain() evidence, target p95: reads < 300ms, writes < 800ms
- Case-insensitive unique email (collection collation)
- Maintain migrations & seed scripts; no silent schema changes

### 7. Feature Workflow (Confirm â†’ Plan â†’ Do)
1. **Understanding**: 1â€“3 lines stating goal and acceptance criteria
2. **Approach**: Define API, schema impact, UI, tests
3. **Implement**: Small, reviewable steps behind feature flags if needed
4. **Update**: All 3 documentation files
5. **PR**: Include tests + screenshots (for UI)

### 8. Definition of Done
A change is "Done" only if:
- âœ… Lint + typecheck + unit/integration/e2e tests pass in CI
- âœ… Images build and containers are healthy
- âœ… Security checks pass (dep scan/SAST; basic DAST on changed endpoints)
- âœ… Responsive UI verified (mobile-first), accessible focus states
- âœ… The 3 docs are updated

### 9. Verification
- After delivery, explicitly ask: "Please verify this in UI/API"
- Convert feedback into tests where feasible

### 10. Debugging
- On failure: Add targeted logs/asserts, reproduce minimally, read container logs
- After fix confirmed: Remove debug artifacts and test scaffolds

### 11. No Shortcuts
- If something risks quality/security, stop and discuss options
- Prefer slower + correct over fast + fragile

### 12. SSO & Long-term Alignment
- Design with SSO (OIDC/SAML) in mind from day-1 (stub routes now, integrate later)
- All stubs/dummy flows must align with final architecture (routing, RBAC, error contracts, upload security)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL OPERATIONAL STATUS

1. **DEPLOYMENT TARGET**: AWS EC2 Instance (51.20.125.246)
2. **ENVIRONMENT**: Development/Demo (HTTP only, MongoDB with auth)
3. **DOCKER ORCHESTRATION**: All services run via Docker Compose
4. **CI/CD**: Automated via GitHub Actions (appleboy/ssh-action)
5. **SECURITY MODE**: Development (COOKIE_SECURE=false for HTTP)

Admin Portal highlights:
- Guarded by `/admin` base path; unauthenticated or member-role access redirects to `/`.
- Dashboard shows aggregate counts (users, policies, active members) with quick navigation cards.
- Users module defaults to External vs Internal tabs, inline search, and exposes reset/set password actions plus policy assignment workflow on the detail page.
- Policy, Category, and Service Type forms share consistent validation messaging and rely on the API's structured DTO rules.
- Policies feature Plan Versions with full lifecycle: create draft, publish, and make current.
- Assignments support plan version override (cohorting): admins can assign specific published versions to individual members, overriding the policy's current version.
- Plan Versions workflow: DRAFT â†’ PUBLISHED, with version auto-incrementing and date validation.
- Shared fetch utility prefixes `/admin` requests so all client calls route through Next.js rewrites to the API container.

## Current Deployment State (September 19, 2025)

### AWS EC2 Instance (ACTIVE)
```
Instance Type: t2.micro
Region: eu-north-1
Public IP: 51.20.125.246
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Storage: 30GB gp3
Security Groups: HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), SSH(22)
Instance ID: [REDACTED]
```

### Docker Services Status
- **MongoDB**: Running on port 27017 (containerized)
- **API**: Running on port 4000 (NestJS)
- **Member Portal**: Running on port 3002 (Next.js)
- **Admin Portal**: Running on port 3001 (Next.js)
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy on port 80

### CI/CD Pipeline (SIMPLIFIED & WORKING)
**GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Method**: Simple SSH deployment (like IntelliReports)
- **Process**:
  1. SSH to EC2 (51.20.125.246)
  2. Pull latest code with `git pull`
  3. Stop existing containers
  4. Build all services with `docker-compose build --no-cache`
  5. Start containers with `docker-compose up -d`
- **Deployment Time**: ~10-15 minutes
- **Success Rate**: 100%

### Why This Works (Lessons from IntelliReports)
1. **Simple is Better**: One job, one SSH connection, straightforward commands
2. **Build on EC2**: No complex artifact handling or multi-stage builds
3. **Background Build**: Build process runs in background with progress monitoring
4. **No Caching Issues**: `--no-cache` ensures fresh builds every time
5. **Platform Consistency**: Building on EC2 ensures linux/amd64 compatibility

### Known Security Gaps (Development Environment)

#### ðŸ”´ Critical for Production
1. **No HTTPS/SSL**: Running on HTTP only
2. **MongoDB authentication**: Basic auth enabled
3. **Cookies without Secure flag**: Required for HTTP but insecure
4. **JWT secret hardcoded**: Using development secret
5. **CORS limited to localhost**: Update to production domains before go-live
6. **Rate limiting configured for demo**: Global (100/15min) and auth (5/15min) limits active; revisit thresholds for prod scale
7. **Secrets in docker-compose**: Should use secrets management

#### ðŸŸ¡ Important Improvements
1. **No backup strategy**: MongoDB data not backed up
2. **No monitoring/logging**: No centralized logging system
3. **No health checks alerts**: Services can fail silently
4. **Default ports exposed**: MongoDB port should be closed
5. **No firewall rules**: Beyond AWS security groups
6. **No input sanitization**: XSS/SQL injection risks
